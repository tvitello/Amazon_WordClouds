WordClouds for DS559 Final Project at UVA, Summer 2020

Project teammates also include Huilin Chang and Gavin Wiehl


Users should first access <http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/> and download the json.gz files corresponding to "Movies and TV" and "Baby", respectively.

These can be each accessed here: <http://snap.stanford.edu/data/amazon/productGraph/categoryFiles/reviews_Movies_and_TV_5.json.gz>

and here: <http://snap.stanford.edu/data/amazon/productGraph/categoryFiles/reviews_Baby_5.json.gz>

Each notebook (Amazon_Baby_Wordcloud and Amazon_Movies_Wordcloud) will process the specified JSON files from the Julian McAuley UCSD page, ultimately generating word clouds used as part of the final deliverables of the DS5559 Summer 2020 course at UVA.

To generate the word clouds, a .JPG file will be included for use as the mask.

Cheers,

Travis
